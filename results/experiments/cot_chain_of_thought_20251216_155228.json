      "expected_answer": "7 or 8",
      "actual_answer": "Here's the solution:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many cookies Sarah gave to her friend.\nSince she gives half of 15 cookies, we can calculate it as: 15 / 2 = 7.5\nHowever, since you can't give a fraction of a cookie, we'll consider that she gave away approximately 7-8 cookies (as you can't divide a whole cookie).\n\nLet's assume she gave away 7 cookies for simplicity.\n\n2. Now, let's subtract the number of cookies she gave to her friend from the original amount: \n15 - 7 = 8\n\n3. This means Sarah has 8 cookies left.\n\nFinal answer: Sarah has 8 cookies left.",

Since Fluffy is specifically identified as a \"cat\", it falls under the category of all cats.\n3. Therefore, by transitive inference, if all cats are animals, and Fluffy is a cat, then Fluffy must also be an animal.\n\nFinal answer: Yes",

Holding an umbrella will create a barrier between you and the rain, preventing direct contact with the water droplets.\n3. Assuming proper use of the umbrella (open and pointed downwards), it should effectively shield you from getting wet.\n\nFinal answer: No, assuming proper use of the umbrella, you will not get wet while going outside on a rainy day.",
